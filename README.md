## My process

### Built with

## What I learned

I learned using flexbox can be tricky when making a two column layout. Also, you are added more utility classes using flexbox which is uncessary. So, I ended up using CSS Grid. I wanted the image on the right and used the code below. 

```html
<figure class="order-1">
  <img>
</figure>
```
